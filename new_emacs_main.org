* Package installers

** MELPA

The reference for getting started with [[http://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]]. Since I'm on Emacs 24, I
used
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

to add MELPA. (!) But only after running ~M-x package-list-packages~,
was I able to find and install packages from the MELPA archives.

* Color themes

** emacs-solarized

Install solarized color-theme

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/emacs-color-theme-solarized")
(load-theme 'solarized t)
#+END_SRC

I couldn't get the dark theme to load.


** bbatsov/solarized-emacs

from [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][bbatsov/solarized-emacs]]: ~M-x package-install
solarized-theme~. Requires MELPA.
